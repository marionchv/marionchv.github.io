# About Me

#### I am a PhD student working at the [TIMC lab](https://tree-timc.github.io/) (Grenoble) and the [Gulliver lab](https://www.gulliver.espci.fr/?-home-) (ESPCI, Paris). My research lies at the intersection of Physics, Machine Learning, and Biology, where I develop generative models for protein sequences.
