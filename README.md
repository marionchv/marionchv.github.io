# About Me

#### I am a researcher working at the intersection of Physics, Machine Learning, and Biology. My PhD focused on generative models for protein sequences and was conducted under the supervision of Ivan Junier and [Olivier Rivoire](https://statbio.net/), between the [TIMC laboratory](https://www.timc.fr/) (Grenoble) and the [Gulliver lab](https://www.gulliver.espci.fr/?-home-) (ESPCI, Paris). I am currently open to postdoctoral opportunities.
